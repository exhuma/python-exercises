    "\n",
    "This page is a \"Jupyter Notebooks\" which contains blocks (called \"cells\") of Python code.\n",

    "## Running code\n",
    "\n",
    "To run the code in a cell, select it by clicking on it and hit \"SHIFT + Enter\" on the keyboard. You can also click the \"Run\" button in the toolbar if the cell is selected.\n",

    "# Variables\n",
    "\n",
    "Variables are one of the main building blocks of programming. An easy way to think about it, is that a variable is a label for a value. It allows the same value be reused over and over again. For example, the code below uses the same value multiple times:\n",
    "\n",
    "    print(\"The total price for one hour is:\", 60 * 0.16)\n",
    "    print(\"The total price for two hours is:\", 120 * 0.16)\n",
    "    \n",
    "This can be simplified by using a variable for the \"price per hour\". Variable names can be chosen freely. It is useful to use a name that represents what kind of value it contains. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "    price_per_minute = 0.16\n",
    "    print(\"The total price for one hour is:\", 60 * price_per_minute)\n",
    "    print(\"The total price for two hours is:\", 120 * price_per_minute)\n",
    "\n",
    "The code below contains a lot of duplicated values. Remove them by using creating new variables. Each numerical value should only appear once!"
